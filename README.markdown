## Slide Show (S9) Template Pack - Slidy (W3C Blue)




## Troubleshooting 

Trouble downloading? Do you have a direct internet connection? If not, configure your proxy using
the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable. Sample:

    HTTP_PROXY=http://234.445.454:4341

Or with user credentials (that is, login and password):

    HTTP_PROXY=http://gerald:topsecret@234.445.454:4341

If all fails, you can always download the template pack on your own (using lets say `git` itself)
and than move the souces into your templates folder (that is, `~/.slideshow/templates`).
